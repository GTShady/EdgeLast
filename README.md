# EdgeLast

"The Ultimate Proxy!", A really good Browser Proxy to escape Censoring.

It can be used as:

- An end-to-end encrypted, cloud-based browser accessible from any device at anytime
- A headless browser that can be embedded in other websites and applications
- A fast, lightweight, and no-installation alternative to Puppeteer, Playwright, and Selenium
- An alternative to Ultraviolet, Rammerhead, and other web proxy browsers
